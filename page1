I try to go back to the time
I felt like I could do anything
Dreaming among the planets
Wishing upon so many stars
Now I achieved almost everything I wanted
I sang with the stars I dreamed of
I met great teachers, friends and lovers
But now I want to go back to the page 1
of my life
of my archive
of my time
of my love
of my life
of my archive
of my time
back to the page 1
of my love
of my life
of my archive
of my time
of my love
of my life
of my archive
of my time
of my love
I try to go back to the time
I felt like I had everything
Dreaming of being somebody I never was before
And then some more
It's funny how the time flies
Running wild
We're given chances all to take
But never twice
Holding breath has never been easy
Sinking down to my past
I wish you'd see me
See me like I'm on TV
Singing my life like Stevie
I'm wondering what could've been
But where's the purpose or meaning?
Already green here
Okay I'm guessing that's just how it goes
A bad memory been a problem
The exact reason I record
of my life
of my archive
of my time
of my love
of my life
of my archive
of my time
of my love
of my life
of my archive
of my time
of my love
of my life
of my archive
of my time
of my love
All my life
All my pride
All of the good days I wished good bye
All my lies
All my sighs
Even the times I lost what was once mine
All my life
All my pride
All of the good days I wished good bye
All my lies
All my sighs
Even the times I lost what was once mine
